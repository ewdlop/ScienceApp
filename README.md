## Scientific CheatSheet

> Why does Moore's law start to fail below 1nm?

  me: The probability of Quantum Tunneling increases (quantum effects start to occur < 1nm). (Electrical)Current starts to leak out of logic "gate".

> What is a semiconductor(semiinsulator)?

 Me: The applied voltage controls its resistance, so it can sometimes be a conductor and sometimes an insulator.

> How do experiment physicists drive particle beans in LHC
  me: F = qv Ã— B.

## Scientific CheatSheet

> Why does Moore's law start to fail below 1nm?

  me: Probability of Quantum Tunneling increases (quantum effects start to occur < 1nm). (Electrical)Current starts to leak out of logic "gate".

> What is a semiconductor(semiinsulator)?

 me: its resistance is controllable by the applied voltage, so sometimes it is a conductor and sometimes it can be an insulator.
